### How does Socket work in C#?
**Sockets** allow communication methods between two processes through the same or different networks/machines. C# itself provides the `System.Net.Sockets` namespace to handle the sending and receiving of data during network communication.

### What is socket programming ?
**Socket programming** is a way of connecting two nodes so that they can communicate with each other over a network. To be connected, one node (Client) will act as a socket that listens on particular port, while the other node (Server) acts by reaching the port of the other socket.

## Stage of Server
- **Protocol:** Using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as a reliable network communication protocol, with socket type Stream.
- **Connection:** Assosiate server’s IP address and port no. with, the socket can send or receive data from the socket client (Bidirectional).
- **Threading:** Uses `threads` to handle sending and receiving messages simultaneously.
- **Checksum:** It includes functionality to calculate and validate checksums for message integrity.
- **Logging:** It logs various events with timestamps for debugging and monitoring.
